**So, when I started to open a private instance for the challenge, this what pop ups to my terminal.**

**First, I tried inputting a string of "yes" and a boolean value because it asks if this is a flag?.**

**Both just replied the same thing I entered, and nothing happens.**
**Now I just entered anything I can think of, I tried inputting bunch of letter A's.**

**Interesting, it said "undefined" and from the error alone I can say that this blackbox runs on JavaScript because of node and jsbox, I can almost think of that it calls a function every time when it is not a string, integer or boolean value...**


**So, I tried to input, console.log because it is the first function I can think of.**

**So, it accepted as function, is it intriguing that ```blackbox("is this a flag?")``` this is like a function? should I try inputting this?**

**So, it is a function, what if I try putting something inside the blackbox function? I tried inputting ```blackbox(blackbox)``` as my first input**

**So, it said that the flag must be a string... I tried everything here almost spent 1hr for this particular blackbox, it always spews false**

**So, I just think, is there any code that can return a function's code? maybe I can get a clue, on how the blackbox function works. So, I search through it and found one.**
**It says that you can use .toString() function to spew out its code.**

**but all I got is nice try, maybe there is something much more safer and doesn't get filter, I know I am near here.**

**I found a method after searching a bit long time on how to call a function code and make it a String**
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/toString


**particularly this function ```Function.prototype.toString.call("foo");```.**
**Now instead of just calling the "foo" in there, I tried calling the function blackbox**

**And there you go! I got the flag here which is:```gaslightCTF{n4t1v3_c0d3_0r_n4t1v3_fl4g?_27f31fa120a2}```**
**kind of ironic because it is really the native code XD**
